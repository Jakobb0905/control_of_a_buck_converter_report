The uncontrolled converter shows a significant overshoot and oscillation before settling to the working point at startup. The controlled converter shows a much smoother startup behaviour, but the settling time is longer than for the uncontrolled converter as shown in \autoref{fig:comparison_startup}.

The load-jump behaviour of the controlled converter still shows a spike at the load-jump, but quickly settles to the working point as can be seen in \autoref{fig:comparison_load_jump}, whereas the uncontrolled converter delivers a higher unwanted constant ouput voltage after the jump.

The input noise feedthrough of the controlled converter is significantly reduced, although not completely eliminated, compared to the uncontrolled converter as can be seen in \autoref{fig:comparison_input_noise_feedthrough}.

Overall, the behavioural characteristics of the converter have improved with the addition of the \Gls{acr:pid}-Controller.

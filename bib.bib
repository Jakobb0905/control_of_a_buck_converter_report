Although the problem of ESD in integrated circuits (ICs) has received much attention industry-wide since the late 1970s, design of robust ESD circuits remains challenging because ESD failure mechanisms become more acute as critical circuit dimensions continue to shrink. In the past increased sensitivity of smaller devices, coupled with a lack of understanding of ESD phenomena and the consequent trial-and-error approach to ESD circuit design, resulted in design of ESD protection effectively starting from scratch in each new technology. Now, as life cycles of new technologies continue to decrease, better analysis capabilities and a systematic design approach are essential to accomplishing the increasingly difficult task of adequate ESD protection-circuit design.},

  abstract = {Purpose – Present 3D electromagnetic simulators have high accuracy, but they are time and memory expensive. Because of that, fast and simple expression for impedance is also necessary for initial inductor design. In this paper new efficient method for total impedance calculation of ferrite electromagnetic interference (EMI) suppressor is given. By using an algorithm, it is possible to predict correctly all variations of electrical characteristics introduced by varying geometry parameters of EMI suppressor. Design/methodology/approach – The starting point for calculation of electrical characteristics of EMI suppressor is Greenhouse theory. Greenhouse decomposed inductor into its constituent segments. Basically, all segments of conductive layer are divided into parallel filaments having small, rectangular cross sections. The self‐ and mutual‐inductance were calculated using the concept of partial inductance. Total impedance of EMI suppressor is calculated taking care of dimension of chip size, material that are used and geometry of conductive layer. Findings – The Simulator for Planar Inductive Structures (SPIS™) simulates effects of ferrite materials and geometrical parameters of planar inductive structures. With proposed software tool, designers can predict performance parameters quickly and easily before costly prototypes are built. SPIS™ software offers substantially reduced time to market, and increases device performance. The computed impedances, given by our software tool are compared with measured data and very good agreement was found. Practical implications – Applied flexible efficient methods for impedance calculation of EMI suppressor are able to significantly increase the speed design of multilayer suppressors for universal series bus, low‐voltage differential signaling and in other high‐speed digital interfaces incorporated in notebooks and personal computers, digital cameras and scanners. Also, ferrite suppressors have been successfully employed for attenuating EMI in switching power supplies, electronic ignition systems, garage door openers, etc. Originality/value – The paper presents realized structures of ferrite EMI suppressors. New geometries of conductive layer are proposed. In addition, using simple model of inductor, the paper develops a CAD simulation tool SPIS™ for calculation of electrical characteristics of EMI suppressors with different geometry of conductive layer.},

  abstract = {Long-term observation of the triboelectric effect has not only proved the feasibility of many novel and useful tribo-devices (e.g., triboelectric nanogenerators), but also constantly motivated the exploration of its mysterious nature. In the pursuit of a comprehensive understanding of how the triboelectric process works, a more accurate description of the triboelectric effect and its related parameters and factors is urgently required. This review critically goes through the fundamental theories and basic principles governing the triboelectric process. By investigating the difference between each charging media, the electron, ion, and material transfer is discussed and the theoretical deduction in the past decades is provided. With the information from the triboelectric series, interesting phenomena including cyclic triboelectric sequence and asymmetric triboelectrification are precisely analyzed. Then, the interaction between the tribo-system and its operational environment is analyzed, and a fundamental description of its effects on the triboelectric process and results is summarized. In brief, this review is expected to provide a strong understanding of the triboelectric effect in a more rigorous mathematical and physical sense.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a simple way to design a proportional integral derivative proportional integral derivative (PID) controller for a DC-DC buck converter. This work concerns getting the formula to calculate Kp, Ki, and Kd parameters from a PID controller easily. The main advantage of this formula is that the tuning process of the KP, KI and KD parameters of the PID controller will be simplified just by entering the R, L, and C component values of the buck converter into the formula. The synthesis process of the formula is explained step by step. State space analysis is used to model the equations and transfer functions of the buck converter. The transfer function of the PID controller and buck converter was analyzed to obtain the Buck Converter system's closed loop transfer function. The formula for calculating the parameters KP, KI and KD of the PID controller is derived from the closed loop transfer function of the buck converter system. Numerical simulations are provided to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed PID controller. The performance of the buck converter controlled by the proposed PID controller was tested under various load conditions.},

  abstract = {As the world is marching into the era of the internet of things (IoTs) and artificial intelligence, the most vital development for hardware is a multifunctional array of sensing systems, which forms the foundation of the fourth industrial revolution toward an intelligent world. Given the need for mobility of these multitudes of sensors, the success of the IoTs calls for distributed energy sources, which can be provided by solar, thermal, wind, and mechanical triggering/vibrations. The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) for mechanical energy harvesting developed by Z.L. Wang's group is one of the best choices for this energy for the new era, since triboelectrification is a universal and ubiquitous effect with an abundant choice of materials. The development of self-powered active sensors enabled by TENGs is revolutionary compared to externally powered passive sensors, similar to the advance from wired to wireless communication. In this paper, the fundamental theory, experiments, and applications of TENGs are reviewed as a foundation of the energy for the new era with four major application fields: micro/nano power sources, self-powered sensors, large-scale blue energy, and direct high-voltage power sources. A roadmap is proposed for the research and commercialization of TENG in the next 10 years.},

Although each and every material exhibits triboelectrification, its quantification has not been standardized. A triboelectric series has been qualitatively ranked with regards to triboelectric polarization. Here, we introduce a universal standard method to quantify the triboelectric series for a wide range of polymers, establishing quantitative triboelectrification as a fundamental materials property. By measuring the tested materials with a liquid metal in an environment under well-defined conditions, the proposed method standardizes the experimental set up for uniformly quantifying the surface triboelectrification of general materials. The normalized triboelectric charge density is derived to reveal the intrinsic character of polymers for gaining or losing electrons. This quantitative triboelectric series may serve as a textbook standard for implementing the application of triboelectrification for energy harvesting and self-powered sensing.},
